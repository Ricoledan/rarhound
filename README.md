# rarhound

RARHound is a simple python CLI tool that does the monotonous work of unpacking RAR files recursively within a specified directory so you can concentrate on enjoying your content rather than manually unpacking them. As an avid user of PLEX, I found that I spent a lot of time searching and unpacking RAR files, RARHound takes the headache out of that process.

## Commands

`python rarhound.py -f <directory>`

## Dependencies

`pip install rarfile`
